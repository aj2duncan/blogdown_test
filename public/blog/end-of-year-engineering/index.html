              <p>Reflecting on the engineering and stats courses that I taught this year, I'd say the engineering course went ok. There is a lot of stuff to cover in the course and several weeks of snow and the holidays got in the way to make everything a little difficult. It acually came down the the students quite a lot. Those who put in the work at home got on fine and those who didn't put the work in or didn't attend quite so much found it a struggle.</p>
<p>I set the students homework exercises but if I get a chance to teach it again I will start these exercises in week one so they get a proper grounding in the basics as these are very important for the rest of the course. Some topics are harder than others and I now have a better idea of those difficult topics and will be able to change the timings to take longer over these.</p>
<p>The course is split into two outcomes and I delayed the first assessment because the start of the second outcome used the skills tested in the first assessment, so by delaying the students got more practice with these skills.</p>
<p>Next time I will try as much as possible to use contextualised material for the engineers so that it isn't quite as mathematical. I got the best response from the students when the material was contextualised - so I need to alter as many of the examples as possible.</p>
