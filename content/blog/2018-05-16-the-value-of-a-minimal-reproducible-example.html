<p>I’m writing this down in the hope that it will remind me in the future.</p>
<p>Although I have used a <a href="https://gist.github.com/hadley/270442">minimal reproducible example</a> before, I found one particularly useful the other day.</p>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level3">
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>I had developed a <a href="https://shiny.aj2duncan.com">shiny</a> app and part of this was a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> map where users are able to click the map to add a marker, these are later captured. However, the markers always appeared below and to the right of where the point clicked.</p>
<p>Checking the usual sources of helpful advice (Google, Stackoverflow) yielded nothingm, so I started from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-solution" class="section level3">
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Really quite quickly I found the answer. Due to running the app on a shiny server, behind ssl I was using a custom declaration for the markers to make sure they were also using ssl.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>markers &lt;- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-icon.png&quot;,
  shadowUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-shadow.png&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>What I had neglected to do was to take into account that by default <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet</a> puts the marker image with the top left of it at the actual latitude and longitude you want marked. Setting the anchor points sorted everything out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>markers &lt;- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-icon.png&quot;,
  iconAnchorX = 12, iconAnchorY = 41,
  shadowUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-shadow.png&quot;,
  shadowAnchorX = 12, shadowAnchorY = 41
)</code></pre>
<p>I don’t know how long this would have taken if I hadn’t built it up piece by piece - keeping it as minimal as possible. Hopefully I’ll remember how useful the process was next time around.</p>
<p>Full code for the minimal shiny app is here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(shiny)
library(leaflet)

ui &lt;- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(12, leafletOutput(&quot;map&quot;))
  )
)


server &lt;- function(input, output) {
  
  output$map &lt;- renderLeaflet({
    leaflet(&quot;map&quot;) %&gt;%
      setView(lng = -3.64, lat = 57.36, zoom = 8) %&gt;%
      addTiles() 
  })
  
  observeEvent(input$map_click, { 
    markers &lt;- makeIcon(
      iconUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-icon.png&quot;,
      iconAnchorX = 12, iconAnchorY = 41,
      shadowUrl = &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-shadow.png&quot;,
      shadowAnchorX = 12, shadowAnchorY = 41
    )
    
    leafletProxy(&quot;map&quot;) %&gt;%
      addMarkers(lng = input$map_click$lng, lat = input$map_click$lat,
                 icon = markers)
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)</code></pre>
</div>
