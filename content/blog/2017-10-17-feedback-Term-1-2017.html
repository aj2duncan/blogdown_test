<p>As with <a href="https://aj2duncan.com/blog/feedback-term1-2016/">previous</a> <a href="https://aj2duncan.com/blog/feedback/">years</a>, I collected feedback at the end of the first term of teaching by putting up four questions I wanted answered on up on the whiteboard and then leaving the room. I will follow this up with a <a href="http://socrative.com/">Socrative</a> quiz to double check these things and collect any individual feedback, in case someone didn’t want to speak up in class.</p>
<p>Anyway here are the questions and the feedback. Any comments of mine are in <em>italics</em>.</p>
