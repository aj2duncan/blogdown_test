### Current Research

I am currently working at both the [SRUC Epidemiology Research Unit](http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120249/epidemiology_research_unit) where I mainly model disease spread through herds of cattle and at the [River and Lochs Institute](http://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/research-enterprise/res-themes/environmental/rivers-and-lochs-institute) where I do some programming and statistical modelling. I also do a little bit of website design and work a lot with the statistical software [R](http://cran.r-project.org/).

### Websites and Software

- [Strandings.org](http://www.strandings.org) is the website of the marine stranding scheme scotland and something I have been working with for a few years. This website has details of strandings (once they have been confirmed and/or post mortemed) and they can be mapped or basic statistical charts shown. 
- The [Online Epidemiology resource centre](http://epidemiology.sruc.ac.uk) which I built as part of my work with the  [Epi Unit](http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120249/epidemiology_research_unit). It hosts a number of online models and calculators all built with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), including a [Two-stage Sample Size Calculator](http://epidemiology.sruc.ac.uk/shiny/apps/Two-stageSampleSizeCalculator/) to help design surveys to estimate Herd Level Prevalence when the individual test is imperfect. 
- My own [shiny server](https://shiny.aj2duncan.com/) to use for any apps I develop for teaching or just for my own interest.
